We dicussed what the future had in store and where we wanted to go. We restructured our team while provoking the emotions that were driving us forward.">

Expanding my programming expertise was definitely on my radar, but I wanted to push the limits even further by cementing myself as a one-of-a-kind entrepreneur whose story could be told to those looking to start up their own company. It was tough figuring out where to go at first. However, following my instincts helped to build my confidence up as I began to take to steps necessary to accomplish the goals I had set.">

The only real guidelines were to maintain a steady speed and stay out of Texas to avoid getting pulled over. The currents and patterns associated with travelling across the country quickly became evident as thousands of miles of road, sketchy motels, and gas stations were seen in such a short period of time.">

Lots of amazing food was eaten, and beer was consumed by the pitcher. I began to hover around various hackerspaces in the area. I met Chance the Rapper in Santa Barbara at his 1st sold out show. I travelled up to San Francisco, met dozens of startup-oriented people, and spent all my money. It was a great time.">

They were preparing to take 2 retrofitted buses all the way across the country from Los Angeles to Washington D.C. He offered me a position on the tech team and I promptly took it. We journeyed across the country, designing a new company as  we went. Breakdowns occurred frequently. After 7 crazy days we finally made it to our destination. I continued working with them on the food trucks for a good amount of time after that.">

						<a href="http://t.co/oQQ6hdFEdQ" data-largesrc="images/slide_outs/the_wild_bunch.jpg" data-title="Making Connections" data-description="Following the fearless leader Justin, I was able to meet many influential people in the United States capital. Dressed in costume, I was introduced to the mayor of DC and the owner of the Washington Wizards when we catered a startup event. Around the same time, we dropped off a free internet wireless device to a group of energy advocates that had set up an off-grid community in the area. The famous Sierra Leon musician Janka Nabay even crossed paths with us many times as he performed at various places around town. Countless others were met during my time in DC and I really enjoyed meeting them all.">

The entrepreneurial lifestyle was starting to take a toll on me and I needed to take a break. I got up one day and vanished from the city, telling no one were I was going. Obviously, I went back home. This was the best place to relax with family. They welcomed me back home and it felt good to return to them a more cultured man with many exciting tales to tell.">

						<a href="http://t.co/oQQ6hdFEdQ" data-largesrc="images/slide_outs/fire.jpg" data-title="Sparking Innovation" data-description="This time in my life was one of the most exhilarating. A hometown friend named Josh introduced me to fire poi and nothing was the same again. We took the costumes I got while working with the Fojol Bros and integrated them into the fire spinning experience. Each trip got more elaborate. By the end, we had started making our sets with Kevlar, copper, and dog chains. Extras were even sold on Etsy to make some money on the side. 1207 photos & 58 videos were captured along the way.">

We wanted to solve a problem in a fun way, which led us to bringing energy to people while in costume. Underground warehouse raves, car batteries, and power drills were all jump-started by us. The 'Energy Wizards' only lasted for a brief period of time, but it truly was an epic service that was provided (one I will never forget).">

						<a href="http://t.co/oQQ6hdFEdQ" data-largesrc="images/slide_outs/stadium_fire.png" data-title="Collecting the Team" data-description="I went up to Tallahassee two times. One was to spin fire in iconic locations in Tallahassee. The other was strictly business. <br><br>The first time, two friends and I drove up to the capital city with newly crafted sparkle poi sets that were filled with steel wool. We lit them up at 3 places (Making Awesome, in front of Doak Campbell Stadium, and Landis Green). Each spot was filmed. <br><br> The 2nd time travelling to Tally was when I went up for the annual shareholders meeting. It was good to reconnect with the Less Team. I also popped in on the first Tallahassee Startup Grind, which was sponsored by a mentor of mine and his company MASSIVE, Inc. ">

						<a href="http://t.co/oQQ6hdFEdQ" data-largesrc="images/slide_outs/garden.jpg" data-title="Planting Seeds" data-description="The house where my family stays at in Florida is custom made. Everything from the foundation up has been constructed by hand. Each member of the family put in work to build the place in which we lived. Friends have helped with deconstruction, plumbing, roofing, and even electrical all to be a part of the actual building process. As the developments continued inside the house, the outside soil sat still. This allowed me to use the money I was getting at a short-term job and put it towards something that would grow on its own.">

I helped to clean up, sell unwanted items, paint, and work on anything else that was needed. The initial buying price was $40,000. More money was put into it during the fixing up process. The end product was sold on the markey for $84,000, thus netting the family about $25,000 in profit.">

						<a href="http://t.co/oQQ6hdFEdQ" data-largesrc="images/slide_outs/hacker_door.jpg" data-title="Visiting a Movement" data-description="With enough cash to get me across the country for a 3rd time, it was time to push the limits yet again and take a road not yet travelled. I had already driven I-10 and I-40, so I switched it up and went with I-70, exploring hackerspaces along the way. Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, Denver, and Las Vegas each had their own maker movement happening. It was the winter season which made this trip the most dangerous one so far. The riskiness kept me focussed the entire time. Looking back, this was my favorite adventure to date.">

						<a href="http://t.co/oQQ6hdFEdQ" data-largesrc="images/slide_outs/3screens.png" data-title="Producing a Product" data-description="The LESS Team tracked me down one fateful night to discuss the opportunities involved within the company. There was a need to produce a custom energy app relatively quickly, so I took on the position. Over the next few months I would work tirelessly day and night developing the 1st LESS Android app. The end result would be tested against multiple screen sizes and adjusted for better capabilities. Multiple threads would be utilized to increase the data processing speed. Animations were created to give that it more a polished feel.">

My brother and I would share a house up on top of a mountain with a balcony overlooking the city. There is good food at every corner and the weather is sunny. Millions of people surround the area all looking for something new to do.">
